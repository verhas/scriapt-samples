HelloWold Sample
================

This is the simplest sample using the scriapt annotation processor. 
This does nothing more than writes the ominous 'Hello World!' text on the screen during compilation.

To get started with the scriapt annotation processor this sample is the first step.

Check the setup of the `pom.xml` the dependency (note that the scope is `compile`) and look at the class file
`HelloWorld.java` in the package `com.javax0.scriapt.sample` to have a grab of the annotation that triggers the
execution of the script.
